    <p> Have you ever had a hungering for something you aren't entirely certain qualifies as food? Well, hunger no longer!</p>
    <p> What you will need: </p>
    <ol> 
        <li>A box of Kraft Dinner Macaroni </li>
        <li>A pot and roughly half a litre to one litre of water</li>
        <li>An amount of milk that you will eye-ball instead of measuring</li>
        <li>Roughly (gestures wildly) <strong>this much</strong> butter</li>
        <li>No sense of taste.</li>
    </ol>

    <p> Got all that, then let's begin!</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Fill your pot with an amount of water that you didn't bother measuring but is probably a bit more than half a litre.</li>
        <li>Set the pot to boil, which will take roughly 2 to 10 minutes depending on appliances.</li>
        <li>Open the Kraft Dinner package and pour the pasta into the water. Leave it to boil until soft.</li>
        <li>Strain pasta from water and dump the water. Add butter, cheese powder from package, and milk to pot, and mix over low heat.</li>
        <li>After sauce has reached desired texture of, "Looks good enough, I think," add pasta and mix until saturated.</li>
        <li>Pour into a bowl of you choice and eat until you remember how you really don't like this stuff. Throw out mostly uneaten remains.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> And there you go, that's how to make a bowl of <span id = delicious>delicious</span> probably edible Kraft Dinner Macaroni!</p>
