    <h1> Chicken Noodle Soup</h1>
    <img id = chickenNoodle src = ./../images/chickenNoodle.jpg alt = "A delicious bowl of soup we will not be making.">
    <p> I bet you're looking for a great homemade soup recipe right? Well, sorry. As I said, I can't cook.</p>
    <p> To begin: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A can of Chicken Noodle soup. Brand is irrelevant.</li>
        <li>A can opener. Extremely important.</li>
        <li>A bowl. Must be microwave safe.</li>
        <li>A microwave plugged into a source of electricity.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Place the can opener on the can, twisting in a circular motion until the can has been opened.</li>
        <li>Empty the contents of the can into the microwave safe bowl.</li>
        <li>Place the bowl into the microwave. Microwave on high for one to two minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove soup from microwave. Let cool for two minutes before consumption.</li>
        <li>It tastes good, but not as good as the memories of when you were young, innocent, and happy, when your grandmother made it for you when you were sick. You miss those days, and wonder if you will ever return to that time when of wonder and discovery, before the passing of time robbed you of these days before you had a chance to truly appreciate them.</li>
        <li>Best eaten with crackers!</li>
    </ul>
    <p> And that's how you make a bowl of Chicken Noodle Soup!</p>
